# Named colors
#
# Format:
#   NameOfColor = red, green, blue [, alpha ] | PreviouslyDefinedNameOfColor | alias(PreviouslyDefinedNameOfColor)
# with values in 0..255 range.
#
# Whenever possible, use named colors in displays
# instead of arbitrary red/green/blue values.
#
# Writing 'NameOfColor = PreviouslyDefinedNameOfColor' defines
# a new color with the name 'NameOfColor', whose RGB-values
# are identical to the RGB-values of 'PreviouslyDefinedNameOfColor'.
#
# In contrast, writing 'NameOfColor = alias(PreviouslyDefinedNameOfColor)'
# will result in the color name 'NameOfColor' redirecting to the color
# 'PreviouslyDefinedNameOfColor'. The effect is that the color
# 'PreviouslyDefinedColor' replaces occurrences of the color 'NameOfColor'.
#
# Color names as well as the keyword 'alias' are case-sensitive.

# Use alarm colors only when you mean to indicate an alarm.
# Avoid using 'Red' which might suggest an alarm
# just because you like the look of red.
# STOP looks similar to red=MAJOR alarm, and is allowed
# for 'STOP' type of buttons
# STOP = MAJOR

# Attention looks similar to a MINOR alarm.
# It is meant to draw attention

# The colors for On/Off, Open/Close etc,.
# "On" does not necessarily mean 'device is turned on', but
# stands for 'indicator is on, active, illuminated'.
# For a 'motor is at target' type indicator, the motor would
# actually be 'off' while the indicator uses the 'On' color.
#
# If one of the states represents an alarm, the corresponding alarm color may be used.
# For example, a limit switch indicator could use colors "Off" and "MAJOR":
# Off when idle, MAJOR when the limit switch was hit and this is an abnormal situation
# that requires attention.
# On = OK
# Off = 60,100,60
